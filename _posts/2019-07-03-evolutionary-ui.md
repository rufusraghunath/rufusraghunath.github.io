I recently had the pleasure of speaking at [JSDay 2019](https://2019.jsday.it/) with my friend and colleague [Giamir Buoncristiani](https://giamir.com), with whom I co-lead the ThoughtWorks Frontend Community.

We're also excited to announce that we'll be giving this talk again at the O'Reilly Software Architecture Conference in Berlin in November.
