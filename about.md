      Hi friend, I'm Rufus 👋🏻
    </p>  
    <p>
      I currently work as a tech lead and lead consultant at <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/">ThoughtWorks</a>.

      I'm passionate about frontend technologies and frequently <a href="/archive">write and speak</a> about patterns and practices in the frontend space.

       In my spare time I like to listen to audiobooks and practice martial arts and acrobatics.
