      Hi, I'm Rufus 👋🏻
    </p> 
    <p>  
      I'm an experienced software engineering leader with a passion for building effective, empowered, and <i>fun</i> product teams. I enjoy enabling and developing other engineers, as well as working closely with product and design to develop a joint strategy.
    </p>
     <p>
      I currently work as a Staff Engineer at <a href="https://beamery.com/">Beamery</a>. Before that I was a Lead Consultant at <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/">Thoughtworks</a>, where I spent seven years delivering custom software for numerous clients all over the world, from startups all the way to enterprises.
    </p> 
    <p>
       Sometimes I <a href="/archive">write and speak</a> about things I'm thinking about.
