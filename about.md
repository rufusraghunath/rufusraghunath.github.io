      I'm a consultant, software developer, and occasional tech lead at <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/">ThoughtWorks</a>. I'm passionate about frontend technologies and frequently write and speak about patterns and practices in the frontend space. I also founded and lead the ThoughtWorks Frontend Community together with <a href="https://www.giamir.com/">Giamir Buoncristiani</a>.

       In my spare time I like to listen to audiobooks and practice martial arts and dance.
