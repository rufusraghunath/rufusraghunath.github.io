<span class="bash-to-english"># About</span>

Functional programmer. Agile consultant. I like to think about things.

I like to work alongside people who get that intense look in their eyes when they talk about their job and donâ€™t mind working late because they love it so much.

Future founder.

I work at <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/">ThoughtWorks</a>.

You can find my CV <a href="https://github.com/rufusraghunath/CV">here</a>.
