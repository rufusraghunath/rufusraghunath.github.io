      Hi friend, I'm Rufus üëãüèª
    </p>  
    <p>
      I currently work as a Tech Lead at <a href="https://beamery.com/">Beamery</a>. Before that I was a Lead Consultant at <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/">Thoughtworks</a>, where I spent seven years delivering custom software for numerous clients all over the world, from startups all the way to enterprises.
    </p>  
    <p>  
      I'm a fullstack engineer with a passion for building effective, empowered, and <i>fun</i> product teams. I enjoy Tech Lead and Engineering Manager roles where I'm responsible for enabling and developing other engineers, as well as working closely with Product and Design. I am experienced leading single or multiple delivery teams, taking responsibility from everything from delivery to technical strategy, staffing, and balancing team autonomy with technical governance.      
    </p>
    <p>
       Sometimes I <a href="/archive">write and speak</a> about things I'm thinking about.
    </p>
    <p>
       In my spare time I like to read, listen to audiobooks, and dance.
